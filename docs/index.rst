Example
=======

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Tab1

      On Tab1,
      we are able to provide a CDN to all the projects that we host.
      This service is graciously sponsored by ..

      We bust the cache on the CDN when the following actions happen:

      * Your Project is saved
      * Your Domain is saved
      * A new version is built


   .. tab:: Tab2

      On Tab2,
      we offer a CDN as part of our **Pro plan** and above.
      Please contact support@readthedocs.com to discuss how we can enable this for you.
